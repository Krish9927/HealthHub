                <h3>What is Medicare?</h3>
                <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities or specific medical conditions.

                <h3>What is Medicaid? </h3>
                <p>Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. Each state administers its own Medicaid program, leading to variations in eligibility and benefits. Medicaid covers a broad range of medical services, including hospital visits, doctor’s appointments, and long-term care.</p>

                <h3>Key Differences Between Medicare and Medicaid</h3>
                <p>While both programs help cover healthcare costs, they serve different populations and have distinct eligibility requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Medicare is primarily for seniors and certain disabled individuals, while Medicaid is based on income level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Medicare has multiple parts (A, B, C, and D) with different coverage options, whereas Medicaid covers a wide range of services, often at little to no cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Medicare beneficiaries typically pay premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, while Medicaid often has minimal costs for recipients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Medicare is managed by the federal government, whereas Medicaid is run by individual states with federal oversight.</li>
                </ul>
